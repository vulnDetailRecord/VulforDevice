### Vulnerability Description
Tenda W30E V16.01.0.19(5037) were discovered to contain a stack overflow in the UploadCfg function.
### Vulnerability details
Stack-based buffer overflow in function UploadCfg on Tenda W30E before V16.01.0.19(5037) devices allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or remote code execution via a crafted parameter for the http post request.

In the function UploadCfg line 93, it reads in a user-provided parameter, and the variable v17 is passed to the _isoc99_sscanf function without any length check, which may overflow the stack-based buffer. As a result, by requesting the page, an attacker can easily execute a denial of service attack or remote code execution.
