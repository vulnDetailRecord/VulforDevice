### Vulnerability Description
Tenda G3 G3V3.0br_V15.11.0.17 were discovered to contain a stack overflow in the guestWifiRuleRefresh function.
### Vulnerability details
Stack-based buffer overflow in function guestWifiRuleRefresh on Tenda G3 before G3V3.0br_V15.11.0.17 devices allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or remote code execution via a crafted parameter for the http post request.

In the function guestWifiRuleRefresh line 38, it reads in a user-provided parameter, and the variable gstUp is passed to the sprintf function without any length check, which may overflow the stack-based buffer. As a result, by requesting the page, an attacker can easily execute a denial of service attack or remote code execution.
